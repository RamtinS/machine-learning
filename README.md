# Machine Learning Models

This repository contains a collection of machine learning models, demonstrating various designs and techniques used across different tasks and domains. Each model is implemented to provide a hands-on approach to understanding core concepts in machine learning.

## Models Included:
- **Regression Models**: Used for predictive analysis and estimating relationships between variables.
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**: Fundamental neural networks designed to mimic the human brain, used for a variety of tasks like classification and regression.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Specialized for image processing and computer vision, used in tasks such as object detection and image recognition.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Designed for processing sequential data like time series, speech, or text, with specialized models like LSTM.
