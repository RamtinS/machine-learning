# Machine Learning Models

This repository contains a collection of machine learning models, demonstrating various designs and techniques used across different tasks and domains. Each model is implemented to provide a hands-on approach to understanding core concepts in machine learning.

## Models Included:
- **Regression Models**: Used for predictive analysis and estimating relationships between variables.
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**: Fundamental neural networks designed to mimic the human brain, used for a variety of tasks like classification and regression.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Specialized for image processing and computer vision, used in tasks such as object detection and image recognition.
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: Designed for processing sequential data like time series, speech, or text, with specialized models like LSTM.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving important information, improving model performance and visualization.
- **Unsupervised Machine Learning:** Used for discovering patterns and structures in unlabeled data, often used for exploratory data analysis and anomaly detection.
